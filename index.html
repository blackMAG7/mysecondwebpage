            <p> after Annie killed the two titans captured by the Scounting Legon, Erwen went closer to Eren and whispered 
                <blockquote><p>
                    what do you see? who do you think the <strong>enemy</strong> is? who do you think is the true enemy?
                </p></blockquote> this clearly shows how smart he was saying that there are humans able to turn into titans other than Eren to later discover that it is Annie
